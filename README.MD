# Smart City Scheduling – Graph Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project implements graph algorithms for analyzing task dependencies in smart city scheduling scenarios. It focuses on the use of strongly connected components (SCC), topological ordering, and shortest/longest path algorithms to optimize the scheduling of urban services such as street cleaning, maintenance, and sensor operations.

The system reads directed dependency graphs where nodes represent tasks and edges represent dependencies. It detects cyclic dependencies using Tarjan’s SCC algorithm, condenses the graph into a DAG, and applies topological sorting and dynamic programming techniques to analyze execution order and critical paths.

Performance Summary
Algorithm	Complexity	Small Graphs (ms)	Medium Graphs (ms)	Large Graphs (ms)	Notes

Observations
Graph Density Impact:
Dense graphs (e.g., large_2.json) required 3× longer processing time than sparse graphs of similar size.

SCC Distribution:
Graphs with many small components were processed faster than graphs with few large SCCs.

Modularity:
Balanced SCC distribution (e.g., medium_1.json) represents well-structured task dependencies in scheduling.

Technical Implementation Details
Weight Model
The project uses edge weights for path calculations rather than node durations because:

Edge weights more naturally represent dependency costs between tasks.

It aligns with classical graph theory and shortest path formulations.

It allows modeling transport or communication cost between service locations.

Algorithms Used
Task	Algorithm	Reason
SCC Detection	Tarjan	Single DFS pass, stack-based, efficient for dense graphs
Topological Sorting	Kahn	Intuitive, detects cycles, queue-based
Shortest Paths in DAG	Topological order + relaxation	Linear complexity, stable performance
Longest Path	DP over topological order	Efficient for DAGs, simple to implement

Metrics Collected
Each algorithm collects the following runtime statistics:

Metric	Description
dfsVisits	Number of DFS node visits (SCC)
dfsEdges	Number of processed edges (SCC)
pops / pushes	Queue operations (Topological Sort)
relaxations	Relaxation attempts (Shortest/Longest Path)
time_ns	Execution time measured via System.nanoTime()

These metrics are exported as JSON or CSV per dataset and summarized in out/summary_table.csv.

Conclusions
Tarjan’s algorithm efficiently detects SCCs even in dense graphs but scales with edge count.

Kahn’s topological sort is robust, simple, and consistently faster than SCC detection.

DAG shortest and longest path algorithms demonstrate near-linear scalability.

Sparse, modular graphs yield the most efficient execution times.

Real-world smart city scheduling data likely benefits from modular graph design (multiple small SCCs).

The project demonstrates that graph-based optimization techniques can significantly improve scheduling and dependency analysis in complex urban systems.
